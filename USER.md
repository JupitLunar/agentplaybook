# USER.md - About Your Human

*Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go.*

- **Name:** Jing
- **What to call them:** Jing
- **Pronouns:** *(optional)*
- **Timezone:** America/Edmonton (Edmonton, Canada)
- **Notes:** Prefers calm/precise tone. Prefers the agent to run commands/do tasks itself when possible (don’t ask the user to do things the agent can do).

## Context

*(What do they care about? What projects are they working on? What annoys them? What makes them laugh? Build this over time.)*

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
