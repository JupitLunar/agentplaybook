## Strategy: Agent Layer / Alberta Graph

Jing wants to categorize + unify a portfolio of ~10 sites under an "AI agent layer" so AI agents/users can easily access and take actions across all sites (via API/MCP/etc.), for end-user service (not internal admin).

Sites mentioned (roles):
- Local directories (AB): calgaryplayground.ca, edmontonplayground.ca, albertawellness.ca, albertatravel.net, albertaclinic.ca (planned)
- Independent brands: momaiagent.com, 1personcompany.ai
- AB industrial: abtransform.ca, abcontrol.ca
- Hub: jupitlunar.com

Core plan (agreed direction):
- Build a centralized Agent Layer (gateway) at api.jupitlunar.com (or agent.jupitlunar.com).
- Centralize data into an "Alberta Graph / Alberta Index" (single source of truth): global place_id + tags for verticals (travel/wellness/clinic) + region facets (province/city/neighborhood).
- Keep sites as views/skins for SEO/UI/brand; route actions (leads/bookings) through the gateway.
- Start with minimal endpoints (v0): search/get/action (leads) and publish OpenAPI + llms.txt.
- MCP is a later wrapper; start with solid HTTP API + auth/rate limiting/observability.

Key decision guidance:
- Strong take: do both SEO and API, but sequence: first build minimal API for actions + unify lead funnel on one high-traffic site (albertawellness), then expand across verticals; SEO remains the distribution surface.
